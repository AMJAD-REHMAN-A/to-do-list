# Task Mangement App

This repository contains a simple Task List app built using React with Material-UI components. The app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks in a user-friendly interface.

## Assumptions

1. **Mock API Service**: For the sake of simplicity and demonstration purposes, this app uses a mock API service implemented in the frontend itself. In a real-world application, you may replace this mock service with a backend server to handle data storage and retrieval.

2. **LocalStorage**: In this app, tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage`. It is assumed that the user's tasks will persist in the browser even after closing and reopening the application. For a production-ready app, you may want to consider using a more robust data storage solution like a database.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project's root directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

3. **Run the app**: Start the development server by running `npm start`. The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Create, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Use the provided interface to create new tasks, view their details, edit them, or delete them as needed. The app will use the browser's `localStorage` to store the tasks.

## Additional Features (With More Time)

Given more time, there are several additional features and improvements that could be implemented:

1. **User Authentication**: Add user authentication to allow users to sign up and log in to their accounts. This would enable personalized task lists and prevent unauthorized access to tasks.

2. **Backend Integration**: Integrate the app with a backend server and database to store tasks on the server-side. This would ensure data persistence and enable multi-device synchronization.

3. **Task Categories and Filtering**: Implement task categories or labels to help users organize their tasks. Allow users to filter tasks based on categories or search for specific tasks.

4. **Task Priority and Due Dates**: Add options for users to set task priorities and due dates. Highlight or sort tasks based on their priority or due date.

5. **Task Completion Status**: Include the ability for users to mark tasks as completed. Implement a toggle to switch between viewing all tasks and viewing only completed tasks.

6. **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Allow users to reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them in the list.

7. **Responsive Design**: Enhance the app's responsiveness to ensure a seamless user experience on various screen sizes and devices.

8. **Error Handling and Validation**: Implement proper error handling and validation for form inputs to provide meaningful feedback to users.

9. **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages to cater to a broader audience.
